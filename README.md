In-System Programming (ISP) aka In-Circuit Serial Programming (ICSP) is the ability of some programmable logic devices, microcontrollers, and other embedded devices to be programmed while installed in a complete system, rather than requiring the chip to be programmed prior to installing it into the system.  In this tutorial the AT89S52 microcontroller is programmed by using Arduino as an In-Circuit Serial Programmer.
